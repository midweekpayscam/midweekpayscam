Providing a safe installment loan marketplace requires a predictable path out of debt. Lawmakers can achieve this by mandating that small-dollar loans be repaid in substantially equal installments of interest, fees, and charges combined and that upon prepayment or refinancing, all loan charges be pro rata refundable, meaning borrowers would not pay for any days remaining on the loan after it was fully paid back. By contrast, allowing prepayment penalties or front-loaded charges, such as nonrefundable origination fees, creates a strong incentive for lenders to push borrowers to refinance in the early months of a loan and acts as a penalty for borrowers who pay off the loan early.
