Midweekpay Loan Approval Scam

Research has shown that conventional payday loans are untenable because they are due in full too quickly—usually about two weeks—and the required payment consumes a third of a typical borrower’s paycheck. Also, payday lenders are the first creditors to be paid because they can access the borrower’s checking account on payday. While this strong ability to collect payments helps credit flow to borrowers with damaged credit histories, it also means that lenders generally do not make sure that borrowers can repay the loan and successfully meet their other financial obligations. To more closely align the interests of borrowers and lenders, state policymakers should ensure that these loans are safe and affordable by limiting monthly payments to 5 percent of a borrower’s gross paycheck. In Ohio, as part of the compromise, lawmakers gave borrowers at least three months to repay and limited monthly payments on short-term loans to 6 percent of gross monthly income.
